I have had many attempts at which I tried setting up a regular blog. Whether that was a monthly blog or a weekly blog, it just didn't really make a difference. I just never got around to writing the posts or finishing the posts in the way that I wanted it to be. I think it's because I'm lazy, to be honest, I'm lazy to type. 

You see the, thing is, I hate typing, typing is slow and my thoughts always run out in front of my fingers and my fingers can’t keep up even though I'm a pretty fast typer. This frustrates me and then forces me to not finish what I'm busy writing.

### Here we go again.
So this is the third iteration of me trying to actually set up a Blog. This time, however, I'm doing it a little bit differently. This time I'm going to speak and have the cloud convert the words that I'm saying into text on my behalf. This way I don't need to type fast and I can speak as fast as my mind can put words in my mouth.

Now this in itself is a problem, cause I might just be saying a bunch of nonsense and it's easier to speak a lot of nonsense when you don’t have to count the number of words you are typing. But don't fret, because every word still needs to be validated and I will need to make sure that all the commas and periods and the capitals are in the places that they should be.

### Voice me!
So this blog post, and every blog post from this point onward will be one that is dictated and that is transcribed using Cloud Voice to Text translation services. Now, I'm not going to tell you guys what services I'm using to do the translation just yet, I want that to be a little bit of a mystery. There's a reason for that and I'll get to that in a later blog For now just know that it's all cloud-based services.

To get to the point of what this blog will be about. This blog, will be about tech things, gadgets, and fun things that I learn and do while functioning as a Solutions Architect. I will most certainly be talking about Big Data, migration workflows, Cloud security, why you need to adopt an agile workflow and most probably go serverless in the next two years.

Let's see how this dictation blog goes along and if I actually spend more time on it than my previous blogs. Here's to reading about the next iteration. Here's To The Next Big Thing
